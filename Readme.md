![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2y2m3v1i0S2V1t2m2A0e/Screen%20Shot%202012-04-21%20at%2012.27.05%20AM.png)

## Installation
To install this plugin, you have two options:

1. Clone source code to Sublime Text 2 packages folder, in Mac it is `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages`.
2. If you have Package Control installed, simply search for `PlainTasks` to install.

## Start a new todo-list
Bring up the command palette (it's `⌘ + shift + p` in Mac and `ctrl + shift + p` in Windows) and type `task` and select `Tasks: New document` command. 

**NOTE:** Save your todo files with `todo`, `todolist`, `tasks` or `taskpaper` file extenstions or just name them `TODO` with no extension.

## Usage
**NOTE:** In windows or Linux use `ctrl` instead of `⌘`

☐ `⌘ + enter` or `⌘ + i`: new task

☐ `⌘ + d`: toggle task as completed

☐ `⌘ + shift + a` will archive the done tasks, by removing them from your list and appending them to the bottom of the file under Archive project

☐ Anything with colon at the end of the line is a project title, you can also nest projects by indenting them. 

☐ You can write plain text as notes or descriptions wherever you want.

☐ You can add tags using `@` sign

### Editor Useful Tools:

☐ Use `⌘ + control + up/down` to move tasks up and down. It is called Swap line up/down.

☐ Use `⌘ + r` to see a list of projects and quickly jump between them

# SublimeTasks
An opinionated todo-list!

## Installation
To install this plugin, do the following:

> Clone source code to Sublime Text 2 app folder
    eg. ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/SublimeTasks

## Usage 
`⌘ + enter` or `⌘ + i`: new task
`⌘ + d`: toggle task completed
`⌘ + shift + a`: archive completed tasks


## Samples 
Suppose we have a following todo file:

	Project A:
	☐ call mum tomorrow at 8 am.
      ☐ talk about something.

Highlight this item line and press "⌘ + d", it marks a tag "@done" and also appends timestamp.

	Project A:
	✔ call mum tomorrow at 8 am. @done (2012-01-08 18:12)
      ✔ talk about something. @done (2012-01-08 18:13)
